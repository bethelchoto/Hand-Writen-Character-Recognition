<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ABOUT THE PROJECT

In today's digital age, the ability to convert handwritten documents or images into editable and machine-readable formats is invaluable. This project aims to create a user-friendly web application that leverages the power of deep learning and Streamlit to seamlessly transform handwritten text from scanned documents or images into editable text documents. The application will provide an intuitive interface for users to upload images containing handwritten text, process them using deep learning models, and then download the converted text in a format like Microsoft Word or PDF.


### BUILT WITH
